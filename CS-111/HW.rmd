# HW 1 Due Friday 8/28 by 5pm

File format: Problems should be completed in a Jupyter Labs notebook, exported to html (we'll talk about this in class).  The .html file should be submitted to NoteBowl under the HW 1 assignment.

Each solution should be written in a seperate Markdown cell, showing the problem number with a header (you can make a header by starting the line with "#").

The first cell of the notebook should have a header for the title of the assignment (CS 111 HW 1), and your name.

The problems for this HW come from the text:

- 1.2.1
- 1.2.2
- 1.2.5
- 1.3.1


All of these problems should be solved in clear, consise English sentences (or lists).  No code here.
