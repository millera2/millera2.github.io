## CS 111 Lecture Notes
*They look great on your phone, so you can read them anywhere.  Steal my code!  Don't understand something?  Ask me!*


- [Week 1](https://millera2.github.io/CS-111/Lec-01.html)
- [Week 2](https://millera2.github.io/CS-111/Lec-02.html)

## Next Quiz

Lecture Coverage:  Week 1

Book coverage: Section 1.1-1.3

Since it's our first quiz, I'll tell you directly the questions I'll ask:

1) Using that the volume of a cone with base radius $r$ and height $h$ is $V=\frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h$, write a syntactically-correct Python function definition that computes the volume of a cone using the two inputs $r$ and $h$.
2) Explain in your own words what "black-boxing" means in problem solving.
3) Explain in your own words what's meant by the "time complexity" of an algorithm.
