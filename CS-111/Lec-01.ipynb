    "1. Computation allows us to solve problems **outside** of our brains.  Woah!\n",
    "2. Computers are stupid.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Voice recognition.  I'm so impressed by the accuracty of the subtitles on Google Meets/Zoom/Youtube etc!  \n",
    "2. Face recognition.  Holy cow, my computer seems to know what I look like!\n",
    "3. Internet search.  How can Google look through the whole gosh-darned internet to find the thing I'm looking for?\n",

    "- Searching engines sucked!\n",
    "- Google Maps gave **awful**, nearly **useless** directions!\n",
