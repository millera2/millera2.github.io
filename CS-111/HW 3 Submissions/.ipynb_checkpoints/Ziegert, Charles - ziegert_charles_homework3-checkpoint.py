    "Functional abstraction provides methods to do some work while hiding details of how this is done. this exercise is all about functional abstraction becuase we had to work on how all the differnt small and Minute details are needed to be successfuly used when it comes to seeing an image created before you. Abstraction is the process of filtering out â€“ ignoring - the characteristics of patterns that we don't need in order to concentrate on those that we do. It is also the filtering out of specific details. By filtering out the different characteristics of patterns we dont need we are able to understand the ideas easier."
