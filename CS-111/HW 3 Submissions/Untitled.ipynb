    "1.It can be considered that there are two levels of functional abstraction. -\tWhen using the functions of\n",
    "“turtle” library, we are using “black-boxes” which create the graphic windows and movements that appear on our screen.\n",
    "We don’t know exactly how such functions like setheading(), setposition() or turtle’s objects are implemented  but we\n",
    "can use the compact representation to play with graphics. -\tIn the slide, zoom and spread functions,\n",
    "I called makeSquare() and makeTriangle() to not have to implement the whole process of drawing a square or a triangle\n",
    "again and also to make my code more compact and easier for other people to read\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tBased on my learning, literally everything we are using right now is the product of layers of functional\n",
    "abstractions. Turtle is just one of millions of APIs and libraries out there. The Windows operating system that I am\n",
    "currently using contains huge number of layers of functional abstraction. Even one of the most simple arithmetic\n",
    "operations, the addition, is built on extremely clever idea of two-stack algorithm and the “stack” data type itself\n",
    "is another function abstraction. Function abstraction makes it a lot easier for users to use highly complicated tasks\n",
    "and also to understand from top to bottom a program. For example, when I implement slide(), I call makeTriangle()\n",
    "instead of writing a for loop and adding a comment which explains that for loop is for drawing a triangle. In this way,\n",
