This is Rstudio!  I take notes here!

It's cool, because I can do math:

```{r}
1+1
```

Note:  the stuff in grey is code.  Unless it's just a mathematical computation, you don't need to worry about it.  But, DO worry about mathematical computations!

I can look at data!

```{r}
head(iris)
```

## Section 1.2 - Data Basics

What's data?  What's a dataset?

Here in 120, we'll be using "rectangular data".

In rectangular data:

- 
- 
- 


In 120, when we say say "dataset", we *always* mean rectangular data.  

Our goal:  say something smart about the individuals based on the data!


## Type of data

Not all data is created equal!  Important!  The tools we use for analysis vary drastically depending on what type of variable we're studying.


Main categories:  

- 
- 


We use -radically- different tools for analyzing each.  Ex:  doesn't make sense to find "mean species".  


We can further subdivide:

Quantitative data can be subdivided into two types:

-  
- 

Interesting caveats:

- Height:

- Money:   


Qualitative data can also be broken down into two types:

- 
- 

## Metadata

Sometimes, it's not always clear what the data represents.

Example:  mpg dataset

```{r}
head(mpg)
```

Not clear what all the variables are!

Answer:  metadata!  Data about data!  Describes:
