# HW 2 - What's In Your Breakfast Cereal?

Due Friday Oct 1 before the beginning of class.  Submit as .pdf document, just like HW 1.

For this HW you'll be looking at data on a selection of common breakfast cereals.  Find the data on our [shared Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1C1XHN3PGe4lMQXS_hq49btBM6QaiEuBW?usp=sharing) (you can click the link here).

(For the record, I'm a Honey Bunches of Oats woman, myself.)

Your goal is to create and analyze linear models for the following:

- Predict `Fiber` based on `Potassium`
- Predict `Protein` based on `Sugar`.

For each, perform the following:

  1) Make a scatterplot, and describe its key features using language from lecture.
  2) Compute the 5 key summary statistics:
    $\bar{x}$, $\bar{y}$, $s_x$, $s_y$, $r$
  3) Compute the equation of the least-squares line.
  4) Carefully interpret the slope of the line, as practiced in lecture.
  4) Make, and interpret, a residual plot.
  5) Compute and interpret $R^2$.

Everything should be neatly and clearly presented in a Google Docs report in complete English sentences and paragraphs.  Exported to .pdf.  

Late HW will not be accepted for any reason.  Students may turn in HW early, of course.
