## Probability Trees

Probability trees provide a handy visual aid for organizing all of the various probabilities we care about.

*Ex*  Suppose a test for a disease advertises itself as "95% accurrate.  This means:  if the test is administered to someone who *has* the disease, the test will show "+" 95% of the time.

Suppose that if a person doesn't have the disease, then they'll test "-" about 85%.

Suppose that 3% of the population has the disease.

Let's draw a probability tree to summarize the probabilities.

![](https://sketch.io/render/sk-0bf647aee623d6b7689a644624480f75.jpeg)

List of Probabilities:

P(+|D) = .95
P(-|D) = .05
P(+|D^C) = .15
P(-|D^C) = .85


P(+ and D) = .03*.95

```{r}
.03*.95
```


P(D and -) = .03*.05

```{r}
.03*.05
```

```{r}
.97*.15
```

```{r}
.97*.85
```

In summary, the tree gives and intuitive layout for all conditional probabilities and "and" probabilites.


Two important uses:

1)  Q:  what percent of people test positive?  Can easily figure it out from the tree.  There's only four possibilities!

  Want to find:  P(+)?  There are only two options for this scenario:  D and + or D^D and +.  So, add up the probabilities!
  
P(+) = .0285 + .1455

```{r}
.0285+.1455
```

About 17.4% of all people in the population will test positive.

2)  What's the probability that, if you test +, you actually have the disease??  Observations:

- this is what YOU care about if you're taking the test!
- "backwards" from what we have right now!  RIght now, we know P(+|D).  We want the other way:  P( D | +)?  

From the tree, we know everyting.  Use the conditional probability formula:


    P(D|+) =  P(D and +)/P(+) = .0285/.174
    
```{r}
.0285/.174
```

If you test positive, there's only about 16.4% chance that you really do have the disease!  Woah!  
    
    
Notes:

- 1 above is the "law of total probability".  To find P(+), we added all the possible probabilities:


    P(+) = P(D and +) + P(D^C and +)
    
- 2 above is Bayes Rule!  Bayes rule is a formula/law for "reversing" conditional probabilities.  Here: we started with P(+|D). But actually, we're interested in the probability P(D|+).

Recall, the test advertises itself as "95% accurate".  BUT, if you get a + result on the test, there's only a 16.4% chance that you really have the disease!!

Think of Bayes this way:  it reverses conditional probability using info from the tree and the definition of conditional probability.


**Example:  Bayes**  Suppose: 

- 0.1% of the American population currently has lung cancer (event "L") 
- 90% of all lung cancer cases are smokers (event "S") 
- 21% of those without lung cancer also smoke. 

(These values are fairly close to the values given on the American Lung Association web site

Construct a probability tree to find the following probabilities:

![](https://sketch.io/render/sk-4d47fdc6b6de928ddfa0eeab2d4a5301.jpeg)


- P(S^C|L) = .1

- P(S and L^C) = .20979


- P(S) = .0009 + .20979 = 0.21069

```{r}
.0009 + .20979
```



- P(L|S) = P(L and S)/P(S) = .0009/.21069

```{r}
.0009/.21069
```




- P(L|S^C) = P(L and S^C)/P(S^C) = .0001/(.0001+.78921)

```{r}
.0001/(.0001+.78921)
```

Q:  how much more likely is it for a smoker to have lung cancer than a non-smoker?

Divide:  smoking lung rate/non smoking rate:

```{r}
0.004271679/0.0001266929
```

Smokers are nearly 34 times more likely to have lung cancer!


```{r}
hist(runif(10000))

## Continuous Distributions - Normal Dist

Context:  let's get to know the most famous probability distribution: normal dist, ie, the bell curve.

Interesting fact:  the normal dist arises naturally in many real life/data applications.  

Cool fact:  the normal dist is seen whenever we examine sums or **means** of random numbers.

```{r}
runif(1)
```

Random real number between 0 and 1.


```{r}
runif(10)
```


```{r}
hist(runif(10000))
```

Punchline:  what if we do this a bunch of times (10000) and look at a histogram of the means/averages:

```{r}
hist(replicate(50000, sum(runif(10000))))
```

Moral of the story:  any time we study averages of randomly selected number (each one from the same population), the means (or sums) will follow a normal dist.

Intuition:  most values are in the middle.  Very large (or very small) results are increasingly unlikely.

The normal dist also arises frequently in biological variables: ex human height is normally distributed.  


Weird thing about the normal dist:  it's a "continuous" distribution.  In other words, we can't list out all the possible options for X.

Ex: Human height.  Not possible to make list of all possible human heights.  Infinitely many!

Because of this, we can't make a distribution table!

Instead:  use a density curve.  To find probability for a normal dist, we need to find area under the density curve.

Ex: Height for adult men in the US follows a normal dist, with mean 69" and std 2.7".

What's the probability that a randomly selected man is less than 70" tall?

What's the probability that a randomly selecte man is between 67 and 68" tall?

**Problem** It's easy to draw the picture, it's hard to find the area!  No simple geometric formula!

If you've taken calculus:  this is an unsolvable integral!  No closed-form solution!

So, we NEED computational assistance.  

1)  Refer to a table
2)  Use software (including Google Sheets)

**One more problem**  There are MANY normal distributions (depending on center and spread).  

Answer:  use the Standard Normal Dist, ie the normal distribution with center = 0 and spread (std dev) = 1.

To perform any of these computations, we'll need to convert our data to a standard normal.  (More on this later).

Let's do some example computations.

NOTE:  The standard normal distribution is ALWAYS denoted by "Z".  

*EX* Suppose Z has a standard normal dist.  Compute the following:

a) P(Z<1.28) = .8997

b) P(Z>1.28) = 1 - P(Z<1.28)   [complement rule]

```{r}
1-.8997
```

c) P( -0.82  < Z < 2.51 ) = P(Z<2.51) - P(Z< -0.82) = .9940 - .2061

```{r}
.9940 - .2061
```



Problem:  if we look up z=2.51 in the table, we'll get ALL the area below that cutoff.  But that's too much!  So, let's subtract off the area below -.82:

From last time:  A sampling dist is a probability distribution for entire sample results.

Now, we're able to answer the following question:  what's the probability of observing a sample result like one we got???


The only reason this is possible is the CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM!  Ie, if our sample is "large enough", then the sample results (xbar, phat) will follow a normal distribution.


We'll start by thinking about categorical data:  our statistic is phat.

Later, we'll think about quantitative data.  Then, our stastic will be xbar.

Important question:  how large is "large enough" for our sample size to ensure that our sample results follow a normal dist.

Answer:  it depends!  If we're talking about a sample proportion, then need the following:


     n*phat >= 10      AND     n*(1-phat) > 10
     
     
     
Another way to think about this:  we need at least 10 individuals IN the category, and at least 10 NOT IN the category.


Example:  IN our class, about 65% of students have brown hair.  There are 50 students.  Is this n large enough to use a normal distribution?

phat = .65
(1-phat) = .35

n = 50

Check:

```{r}
50*.65
```


```{r}
50*.35
```

Yes, n is big enough!


Suppose it's the case that 60% of all DU students have brown hair.  What's the probability that as many students have brown hair in our class as is the case?

What's the probability of observing a sample of 50 DU students, in at least 65% have brown hair?

Let's do the math!

We checked that n is large enough to use normal dist.


We know:

mu_phat = p = .6 
sigma_phat = sqrt(p*(1-p)/n) = sqrt(.6*(1-.6)/50)


```{r}
sqrt(.6*(1-.6)/50)
```

Recall:

    z = (obs - exp)/stdev
    
      = (.65 - .6)/.06928203
      
```{r}
(.65 - .6)/.06928203
```
    
z = .72

Look it up on the table!
    
    
```{r}
1-0.7642
```

If 60% of all DU students have brown hair, there's about a 23.6% chance that in a random sample of 50 students, 65% or more would have brown hair.

Human feelings:  not an unusual sample.




**Ex**  At DU, about 82% of students are from "out-of-state", ie not from Ohio.  If we take a sample of 100 DU students, what's the probability that at least 90% of the students in the sample are from out-of-state?

First, check that n is large enough.

n = 100
phat = .90

```{r}
100*.9
```

```{r}
100*(1-.9)
```

Both are at least 10, but it's close!  For this scenario, we could NOT use a smaller sample!  Thus, we can use the normal dist!

mean = population proportion = .82
stdev = sqrt(p*(1-p)/n) = sqrt(.82*(1-.82)/100)


```{r}
sqrt(.82*(1-.82)/100)
```

obs = .9
exp = .82
stdev = .038

Find the z score!

```{r}
(.9 - .82)/.038
```

z = 2.11.  Look up on table:

```{r}
1-0.9826
```

There's about a 1.74% chance that, in our sample of 100 students, at least 90 of them are from out-of-state.  Pretty unlikely!  Hmmmmmm.....
