## Comparing Normal Distros:  Z-Scores




### ACT/SAT example

The ACT and SAT exams both follow normal distributions, but each has a different center and spread.  The mean score for the ACT is 21 with std dev 6, while the mean score for the SAT is 1100 with std dev 200.

A student named Abby took both exams.  She scored a 28 on the ACT and a 1320 on the SAT.  Which exam did she do better on?  Which score would she prefer to send to schools?
