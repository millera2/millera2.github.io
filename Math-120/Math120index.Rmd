## Office Hours 

### Prof Miller's Hours (Google Meet)

[Google Meet Room](https://meet.google.com/wtr-funk-wph)

Hours: Most weekdays before 4pm.

If you want to talk, shoot me an email (always use Denison email addresses) and propose a couple of times that work for you.

Of course, I don't check email in the evening, so we'll have to meet the next day in that case.

So, **don't wait till the night before a deadline to get help!**  

I like chatting with students -- come find me!

I think this will be better than setting aside specific times that work for everyone.
