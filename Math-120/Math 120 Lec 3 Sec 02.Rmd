### Describing Two Quantitative Variables (Bivariate Data)

Bivariate data is two paired quantitative variables.  I.e., two measurements from the same individuals/cases.

Example:  heights and weights of students in class.

Our goal:  explore relationships between the two variables.  













To visualize bivariate data, we use **scatterplot**, i.e., x-y points for all of the cases.  Each case/individual will be a dot on the scatterplot.









Let's look at some examples:

- mpg hwy vs cty

```{r}
mpg %>% ggplot(aes(hwy, cty))+geom_point()
```

Human feelings:  as hwy measuresments get bigger, so do cty.  Makes sense!  If the care is more efficient on the hwy, i'd expect it's more efficient in the city.  

- mpg displ vs cty

```{r}
mpg %>% ggplot(aes(displ, cty))+geom_point()

```

Human feelings:  bigger cars are less fuel efficient.  Makes sense, a bigger car should need more gas!






- iris sepal length vs sepal width

```{r}
iris %>% ggplot(aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width))+geom_point()
```

Human feelings:  looks like a blob.  Can't really tell any interesting info about sepal width based upon sepal length.  







### Important Qualities of Scatterplots


Just like for histograms, there are some important qualitites about scatterplots that we need to talk about:


- Form/shape.  Do the dots follow a pattern?  Examples: linear, exponential, logistic, quadratic, many others etc.  
- Direction.  Pos or negative.  I.e., do x and y tend to get bigger together (pos relationship), or as x gets bigger, does y tend to get smaller (neg rel).   
- Strength. How closely do the points follow the pattern?  How much "scatter" is there?








In Math 120, we'll study linear relationships in depth (even though there are others, like...)










### The correlation coefficient


In order to measure the strength of a linear relationship, we need an objective mathematical measure (ie a statistic for correlation).  

We call this the "correlation coefficient", r.  

FOr all of Math 120, the letter "r" always means "correlation coefficient".

It's a measure of both strength and direction for a linear relationship.

**Example: mpg data**


```{r}
cor(mpg$hwy, mpg$cty)
```

There's an r value of r=0.96 for hwy and cty mpg.

### Important qualities of r

1)  -1 <= r <= +1

2)  If r is close to +1, then there's a strong positive linear relationship between x an y.

3)  If r is close to -1, then there's a strong negative linear relationship.  (ie the line goes down.)

4)  If r is close to zero, then there's no (or little) LINEAR relationship.


WARNING:  Just because r is close to zero, that doesn't mean there's NO relationship.  Just not linear.

5) R doesn't have units, not affected by units.  Whew!  Doesn't matter what measurement scale you use.  You can convert lbs - kg, ft-meters, etc, and not change r.

6)   Doesn't matter which is x and y.  Same r.
