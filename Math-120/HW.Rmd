# HW 3 - The Titanic

Due Friday Oct 2 by 5pm on Notebowl.  Submit as .pdf document per the usual.

In this HW you'll be investigating a dataset that catalogs details about 890 passengers of the historic Titanic maiden voyage (about 1/3 of the total).

Your goal is to make the following pivot tables:

*(Remember, you can copy/paste your Google Sheets pivot tables into a Google Docs document)*

1) Show **percentages** for survival, broken down by `sex`.  *Hint: Choose `sex` for the rows.

2)  Make a pivot table showing the average age broken down by both `sex` and `Pclass` (passenger class, either 1, 2, or 3).

3)  Check for outliers in `Fare` (ie, the price of the ticket) for each passenger class (`pclass`)

For each of the above pivot tables, write a sentence or two explaining the practical meaning of your findings.

Everything should be neatly and clearly presented in a Google Docs report in complete English sentences and paragraphs.  Exported to .pdf.  

Late HW will not be accepted for any reason.  Students may turn in HW early, of course.



# HW 2 - What's In Your Breakfast Cereal?

Due Friday Sept 18 by 5pm on Notebowl.  Submit as .pdf document, just like HW 1.

For this HW you'll be looking at data on a selection of common breakfast cereals.  [Find the data here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bkgXy3AP8MBGS98_Qhb4Df9L2y0Mjw7YtepJC7H5-9w/edit?usp=sharing)

(For the record, I'm a Honey Bunches of Oats woman, myself.)

Your goal is to create and analyze linear models for the following:

- Predict `Fiber` based on `Potassium`
- Predict `Protein` based on `Sugar`.

For each, perform the following:

  1) Make a scatterplot, and describe its key features using language from lecture.
  2) Compute the 5 key summary statistics:
    $\bar{x}$, $\bar{y}$, $s_x$, $s_y$, $r$
  3) Compute the equation of the least-squares line.
  4) Carefully interpret the slope of the line, as practiced in lecture.
  4) Make, and interpret, a residual plot.
  5) Compute and interpret $R^2$.

Everything should be neatly and clearly presented in a Google Docs report in complete English sentences and paragraphs.  Exported to .pdf.  

Late HW will not be accepted for any reason.  Students may turn in HW early, of course.


# HW 1  - Investigating the Iris Data

Due Friday Sept 4 on Notebowl by 5pm as a **.pdf document.**

To watch me talk about this in video, view the **Week 2, Wednesday Aug 26** lecture video.  Remember, links to lecture vids are on my GitHub homepage millera2.github.io.

This dataset concerns the `iris` dataset that I've shared with you on Notebowl.

HW will be graded on completeness, correctness, and presentation (including the use of English sentences, good formatting, and overall clarity of the work).

Late HW will not be accepted for any reason.  Students may turn in HW early, of course.

## Problem 1 

By making histograms, find a variable in the dataset that seems the most **symmetric**.  Paste the histogram for this variable (just the symmetric one).

What measures of center and spread are appropriate for this variable?  Compute these directly, using appropriate commands in Google Sheets.  Show the commands you used, and your results, in your solution for Problem 1 (along with the histogram).


## Problem 2 

By making histograms, find a variable in the dataset that seems the most **skew**.  Paste the histogram for this variable (just the skew one).

What measures of center and spread are appropriate for this variable?  Compute these directly, using appropriate commands in Google Sheets.  Show the commands you used, and your results, in your solution for Problem 1 (along with the histogram).

## Problem 3

By using the sorting function of Google Sheets, find the mean Sepal Length for each species (*setosa*, *versicolor*, and *virginica*.).
