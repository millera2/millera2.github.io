## Friday 9/6

- Reading discussion:  how did lab go?  Thoughts? Questions? Insights?
- Box Plots and Scatterplots In-Depth
  - Parts of a Boxplot
  - Weird-looking boxplot examples!

## Thursday 9/5

- Lab day!  Still begin with reading discussion.
- You'll have the whole hour to work.
- **Start your lab before class**, so that you can get help!


## Wednesday 9/4
- Textbook:  Chapter 2
- Imporant numerical summaries of data (statistics):
  - mean, median (measures of **center**)
  - standard deviation, iqr (measures of **spread**)
- Important visual summaries of data (graphs):
  - Histograms, boxplots, Scatterplots, Violin Plots
- Describing distributions
  - Understanding **shape**, **center**, and **spread**.
  

## Monday 9/2

- Reading Discussion:  Lab 1
  - Understand the codebook?
  - What variables are you interested in?
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in RStudio:
  -`filter()`
  - Types of visuals, stats
  - How to facet by color (`fill= ...`), and what can go wrong.



## Friday 8/30

- Reading Discussion: Data Types 
  - Continuous, Discrete, Ordinal, Nominal
  - Identify which is which
- Intro to RStudio
  - Start a new RMarkdown file
- Important new code:
