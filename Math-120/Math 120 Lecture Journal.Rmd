## Wednesday 9/4
- Textbook:  Chapter 2
- Imporant numerical summaries of data (statistics):
  - mean, median (measures of **center**)
  - standard deviation, iqr (measures of **spread**)
- Important visual summaries of data (graphs):
  - Histograms, boxplots, Scatterplots, Violin Plots

  - Understanding **shape**, **center**, and **spread**.
  
## Thursday 9/5

- Lab day!  Still begin with reading discussion.
- You'll have the whole hour to work.
- **Start your lab before class**, so that you can get help!


## Friday 9/6

- Reading discussion:  how did lab go?  Thoughts? Questions? Insights?

  - Parts of a Boxplot
  - Weird-looking boxplot examples!
  - When scatterplots make sense (and when they don't)
  
  
## Monday 9/9

Reading Discussion: Sampling Strategies

Can you imagine/invent a scenario?

Sampling 

- Populations, Samples, and Inference

    - **Population**:  All individuals of interest. (Too big!)
    - **Sample**:  A subset that we can actually work with.
    - **Statistical Inference**:  

- Robust Statistics

  - A statistic is **robust** if it's not not affected by skew/outliers.


  - Example: `mpg` displacement




- Observational Studies vs Experiments

  - **Key difference**: In an experiment, we *apply a treatment*.

  - Think: 
    - A survey is ...
    - A medical trial is  ...


   

  - Ex: 1.22a




Sampling Problems

  - We need to be sure our sample is "good"!

    - "Representative" or not?

    - In order to be useful, we need some assurance that the sample is "similar to" the population.  

    - In mathese:  Hope our statistics are close to the true population parameter.


-  Bias, Nonresponse Bias, and Confounding Variables

    - **Sample Bias**:  Some indivuals ("cases") more likely to be observed.
    - **Nonresponse Bias**:  Some individuals excluded from sample selection process.
    - **Confounding Variables**:  Other variables that might affect response variable.

     - Ex:  1,22c, 1.24 and 1.26




Sampling Strategies

  - Simple Random Sample (SRS)

    - Every member of the population is equally likely to be sampled.
    - Best kind!

  - Stratified

    - Break into similar "strata", SRS within each strata.
    - Ensure all groups represented.
    - Example strata: gender, age, income, education, etc.

  - Clustered

    - Break into "clusters", randomloy select which clusters used, sample everyone in chosen clusters.
    - Useful for sample over large geographic area
    - Example clusters: city block, county

  - Multistage

    - First cluster, then SRS within selected clusters.  Nice, but expensive.

    - Ex: 1.19, 1.23
