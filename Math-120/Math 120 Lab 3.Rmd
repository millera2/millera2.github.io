## Introduction


Below are 5 probability problems.  Each one involves a videogame that Prof Miller is playing.  In the game, players face hordes of computer opponents in combat.  Upon defeat, these enemies may sometimes, at random, drop various types of "loot" (valuable in-game resources like new weapons, health packs, or upgrades).

Each problem has three parts:

i) Identify which probability distribution from class (binomial, geometric, or poisson) is needed to solve the problem.  **Warning**:  one of these problems don't follow **any** known distribution.  In that case, you'll need to explain why none of the three distributions work! 

ii) If one of the three distributions can be used, then compte the probability with the appropriate command in R.  

iii)  **On your own**: double-check your calculations by hand!  You'll need to be able to do this for the exam!

Note that I've given you the numerical answers for each one so you can check your work!  Your job is to decide which distro, and use it appropriately.  

**Warning**:  For the one problem that can't be solved, I have provided a nonsense answer, to prevent students from knowing right-away which one it is.  ;D

## The Problems

1) In the game, there's a 7.2% chance for any particular defeated enemy to drop the highest quality loot.  What's the probability that she has to defeat exactly 14 enemies until the first one drops a highest quality loot item?

  - **Answer:**  2.726%



2) In one level of the game, computer enemies spawn (appear) randomly over time.  On average, 6 enemies spawn every 10 minutes.  What's the probability that at least one enemy will spawn within the two minute?

  - **Answer:**  69.881%



3) In one particular quest in the game, the player must compete a "battle arena" challenge:  you must defeat exactly 8 enemies in a row.  Enemies in this fight have a 42% chance of dropping a health pack when they're defeated.  What's the probability that at least 6 of the 8 enemies drop a health pack?


  - **Answer:** 6.337%
 


4) The game world has a simulated day-night cycle with weather, including rain.  The chance of rain varies from location to location from 5% to 17%.  What's the probability that two of the next ten days are rainy?

  - **Answer:**  38.291%

5) In combat, each attack has a 5.2% chance of being a "critical hit" that does double damage.  When engaging an enemy, what't the probability that Prof Miller must attack an enemy at least 4 times until she lands the first critical hit?

  - **Answer:**  85.197%



## Deliverables

You'll turn in a write-up in pdf/doc form to **Notebowl**.  **Do not email me your report.** (You can "Save-As" pdf in either Google Docs or Word.  I strongly recommend Google Docs!)

For each of the 5 problems above, your report should include:

- Which distribution is needed to solve the problem.
- The correct R command for computing the probability

Paste your R code directly into the document.  Don't turn in a seperate .R file.

## Deadline and Grading

This lab is due **Thurs, Feb 27th at 11:59pm**.    **I'll charge a 20% late fee per day late.**
