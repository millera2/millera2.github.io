### Describing Two Quantitative Variables (Bivariate Data)

Bivariate data is













To visualize bivariate data, we use












Just like for histograms, there are some important qualitites about scatterplots that we need to talk about:











In Math 120, we'll study linear relationships in depth (even though there are others, like...)













In order to measure the strength of a linear relationship, we need an objective mathematical measure.  

We call this











Let's look at some examples:

- mpg hwy vs cty
- mpg displ vs cty
- iris sepal length vs sepal width








When talking about correlation, the x and y variables have important roles:













Important properties of *r*, correlation coefficient:
