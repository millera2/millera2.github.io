## I write most of our notes in RStudio

This will be posted online in its entirety.  I'll update it in the afternoon after each class period.

Don't worry about taking word-for-word notes.  You're not a stenographer!  Instead, summarize your thoughts and reactions to help you study later.

I'll also use the board for notes sometimes.
