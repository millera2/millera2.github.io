## Normal Dists (continued)

Recall:  to find probability for a normal dist, need to FIND THE AREA under the normal curve (corresponding to our range).  

Last time:  practiced finding probabilities with the STANDARD NORMAL DIST:  mean = 0 and std dev = 1  (ie the one in the table)

**Warm-up example**  If Z has a standard normal dist, find 

    P( 0.34 < Z < 1.29) = P(Z<1.29) - P(Z < 0.34)
    
![](https://sketch.io/render/sk-b150eb88bc4129ca3bcb24f1d1a79932.jpeg)

```{r}
.9015 - .6331
```


So far, all of our exmaples have been with the standard normal dist.

But what about real data?  How to convert to std normal?

A:  Easy, find a z-score!

    z = (x-mean)/stdev
    
If X has a normal dist, the the above Z converts it to a std normal so we can use the table!  This formula converts our data to have a mean of 0, std dev of 1.

**Example**

Heights for adult men in the US follow a normal dist (this is true) with mean 69" (also tru) and std dev 2.7" (still true!).  

What's the probability that a rando man is 70 inches tall or less?

Step 1:  Get a z score! Convert our data to std normal!

    z = (70 - 69)/2.7

```{r}
(70 - 69)/2.7
```

Note: to use table, MUST round z-score to 2 decimals.  Here, z = 0.37.  

From table:  P(Z<.37) = .6443

There's a 64.43% chance that rando man is less than 70" tall.  


**Ex**  Heights for women in the US follow a normal dist with mean 64", std dev 2.4" (that's all true).  

What's the prob that a randomly selected woman is between 65" and 70" tall?

Idea:  get z scores, look em up!  Answer = big prob - small prob

x = 70:

z=
```{r}
(70-64)/2.4
```

X = 65:

Z =
```{r}
(65 - 64)/2.4
```
z = .42

Look em up!

```{r}
.9938 - .6628
```

There's a 33.1% chance that rando woman is between 65" and 70" tall.

**Ex**  What's the probabability that your math professor is as tall as she is?  75"

```{r}
(75-64)/2.4
```

Hmmmmmmmm!!!  Thinking emoji!

![](https://sketch.io/render/sk-2be5552ef23f8121b75f398dd9947360.jpeg)

Since there's almost no area past z=4.58, 

P(Z>4.58) ~ 0  (approximately zero).

There's almost no chance of randomly picking a woman who's 75" or taller.

Moral of the story:  statistics only tells us about populations, not individuals!



**Ex** What's the probability that a randomly selected woman is less than 75" tall?

P(X<=75) ~ 1.


### Backwards problems

All of the problems that we've seen so far are "forwards problems":
  
   Given a z score, find a probability.
   Given a value, find a probability.
   
**Backwards problems** go the other way:

   Given a probability (area), find the corresponding value.
   
   
   
Ex:  How tall must a man be in order to be in the top 10% of men's heights?


First, let's do some basic ones with the z table.

**Ex** Find the z-score that's larger than 85% of all values in the standard normal dist.

We need to find the z-score with area/probability .85 below.  

![](https://sketch.io/render/sk-f223f260e52b54c768176ac910d2266f.jpeg)

Best z-score (might not always be exact):  z = 1.04.



**Ex** What's the z-score of an individual in the top 10% of measurements.

Need to look up area = 0.9 (that's on the left!!!)

![](https://sketch.io/render/sk-7a8f0a8ffd925df8f7959c238b1f5221.jpeg)

The individual would need a z-score of z=1.28.

## Backwards Problems continued

Backwards problems are how we find "percentiles" for normal dists.

Ex:  40th percentile
$$P_{40}$$

This number is a value (not a probability!) in the dataset that's larger than 40% of data in the distribution.

Ex:  If you score in the 99th percentile (P_99), then you scored higher than 99% of test takers.  (Good thing!)

Ex: A 4-year old is in the 70th percentile of heights for 4-year olds.  P_70.

You already know a couple of special percentiles:

P_25 = Q_1!!!
P_75 = Q_3!!!
P_50 = Median

Called "order statistics", because they show where, in order, the data is.

Backwrds problems are how we find percentiles:

### Typo Corrected!
**Ex** Reticulated giraffes have an avg height of 18.1' and std dev of 1.6', height follow normal dist.  Calculate the 75th percentile (P_75) for giraffe heights.

Equivalent:  how tall must the giraffe be in order to be taller than 75% of all giraffes.

First:  need to find the z-score.  Backwards problem, so look up the area in the table!

![](https://sketch.io/render/sk-3f63f7c25e6258cbc402d680f925f6b6.jpeg)

We find the z-score with area closest to 75% is z=0.67.

Not quite done:  still need to know how tall the giraffe is!

    z = (x - mean)/stdev

Plug in:

    .67 = (x-18.1)/1.6
    
```{r}
.67*1.6+18.1
```

Thus, the giraffe must be 19.172ft tall in order to be in the 75th percentile.



**Ex** Scores on the SAT follow a normal dist with mean 1100 and std dev 200.

How high must a student score to be in the 90th percentile, P_90?

Backwards, since we're looking for a value (not a probability!)  First, find z in the table:  look up the area that's as close as possible to .9.

![](https://sketch.io/render/sk-7a8f0a8ffd925df8f7959c238b1f5221.jpeg)

Best z-score: z = 1.28

Still need to compute the score:

    z = (x - mean)/stdev
    
    1.28 = (x-1100)/200
    
Find x:


```{r}
1.28*200+1100
```

A student would have to score 1356 in order to be in the 90th percentile.


**Special example!**  Again about SAT ( mean=1100 and stdev = 200).  What range of scores encompass the middle 90% of the data?

What are the cutoffs (low and high) that separate the middle 90% most common scores?

Picture!  (Shown below this problem)

We see that for z_low, need to look up area of .05.

Uh-oh!  There are two areas that are equally close (z-scores of -1.64 and -1.65).  No problem, just split the difference:

    z = -1.645
    
Ok, got the low z-score.  What about the high?  Look up area of 0.95:

    z = +1.645
    
Note:  for "middle %" problems, the z-scores always match (+/-) because the normal dist is symmetric!  Gotta be the same on both sides!  Don't really need to look up both. 

Still need to find the scores!  No prob, plug in:

Low:

    -1.645 = (x - 1100)/200
    
```{r}
-1.645*200+1100
```
    
High:

    +1.645 = (x - 1100)/200

```{r}
1.645*200+1100
```

Conclusion:  the middle 90% of scores on the SAT are between 771 and 1429.

**Ex**  Heights for women in the US follow a normal dist, mean = 64" and stdev = 2.4".

Find the IQR for women's heights.

Remember, IQR is the range of the middle 50%!

Picture! (Seen above, below the previous example)

We see we need to find the area = .25.  Look it up: z = -.67 is closest.

Thus, the z-scores are +/- .67

Find the heights:  plug in!

    -.67 = (x-64)/2.4
    
```{r}
-.67*2.4+64
```
    
    +.67 = (x-64)/2.4
    
```{r}
.67*2.4+64
```

Conclusion:  the middle 50% of women range between 62.392 inches and 65.608 inches.

Thus, the IQR = 65.608- 62.392

```{r}
65.608- 62.392
```
