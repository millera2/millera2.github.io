# Abbreviated Even Solutions

## HW 1

### 1.38

a)  Reported median is 125.
b)  New reported median is 130.  Conclusion:  even though the median is **not** sensitive to small fluctuations in data, it **can be affected** by grouping or rounding.

Related topic:  The shape of a histogram can change drastically depending on how wide your bins/categories are!

### 1.42

- Mean:  

$$\bar{y} = \frac{\sum{x_i+c}}{n} = \frac{x_1+x_2+\cdots +x_n+c+c+\cdots +c}{n}$$
$$=\frac{\sum{x_i}}{n}+\frac{nc}{n} $$

$$= \bar{x}+c$$


- Median:  Re-order the elements $x_i$ so that $x_1 \leq x_2 \leq \dots \leq x_n$.

If $n$ is odd, the median element is $x_{(n+1)/2}$.

Since this ordering also places the $y_i$s in ascending order, and so 

$$y_{(n+1)/2} = x_{(n+1)/2} + c$$

is the median.  If $n$ is even we can say the same about $\frac{x_{n/2}+x_{n/2+1}}{2}$

b. Similar arguments show that 

$$\bar{y} = c\bar{x}$$

and

$$ y_{(n+1)/2} = c\cdot x_{(n+1)/2}$$


## 1.44

a) range = 182.6-180.3 = 2.3


b) (note that I did not follow the "hint"; ok if you did)

$$s^2 = \frac{(180.5-181.4083)^2 + \cdots + (180.5 - 181.4083)^2}{11} = .5245$$

c)  $s = \sqrt{s^2} = .7242$

d)  

$$ \frac{394913.6 - \frac{4738894}{12}}{12-1} = .5245 $$
