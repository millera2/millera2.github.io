## Office Hours 

If you want to see me in person, I'm in my office (Olin 214) **Wed 2:30pm-4pm.**

Or, you can catch me on Zoom by appointment.  Don't be shy!  A few things:

- Schedule 24 hours in advance
- I'm free most weekdays from 2-4pm
- When you write, **propose a time** to cut down on back-and-forth.

I never check email after 4pm, so **don't wait till the night before a deadline to get help!**  

I like chatting with students -- come find me!
