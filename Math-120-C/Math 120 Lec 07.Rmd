## The most important distro:  Normal!

Idea:  you know what a prob dist is.

Now:  Let's learn the most important one:  the normal dist (bell curve!)

Normal Dist:  most of us are in the middle.  It's rare to be large or small!

"The" normal dist is actually a family of distributions.  ALl have same shape, 

 - different center (mean)
 - different spread (std dev)  
 
 
Q:  Given teh center and spread of a normal dist, how do we compute probabilities?
 
### Ex: 

Adult men in the US have mean height 69", stdev 2.7".  What's the probability that a ranom man is less than 71" tall?
 
Ex:  What's the prob that rando man is between 68 an 70" tall?

Idea:  PROBABILITY = AREA

PROBLEM:  Can't do it by hand!

Solution:  Two ways:


1) Statistical Tables.
2)  Software, like Google Sheets!


Problem:  lots of different normal dists!  But, only one table!

Answer:  Always use the same one, the STANDARD NORMAL DISTRIBUTION:

- mean = 0
- std dev = 1


Problem:  What if our data is normal, but not STANDARD normal?  Ex:  height!

ANSWER: Z-SCORES! Z-scores count how many std devs above/below the mean an observation is


    Z = (X-mean)/stdev
    
    
### Ex:  

If Z follows a std normal dist, find....


a)  P(Z<1.23) = .8907

b)  P(Z>1.23) = 1 - P(Z<1.23) = 1-.8907

```{r}
1-.8907
```






# Wed March 24

Last time:  Z table shows area to the left of a z-score (std normal score).

### Ex:  

If Z is std normal, find

a)  P(Z< -1.85) = 0.0322

b)  P(Z > -2.53) = 1 - P(Z < -2.53) 
                 = 1 - .0057

```{r}
1 - .0057
```

c)  P( 0.64 <  Z < 3.12) = P(Z<3.12) - P(<0.64) = .9991 - .7389

```{r}
.9991 - .7389
```


d)  P( -2 < Z < 2) = P(Z<2) - P(Z<-2) = .9773 - .0228

```{r}
.9773 - .0228
```

Ah ha!  That's why the Emprical Rule works!



## Backwards Problems

So far:  given Z, find area/prob.  Forwards!

Now:  given an area/prob, need to find Z.  Backwards!

#### Ex:  

What Z-score seperates the lower 80% of the normal dist from the upper 20%?

Ie, find the 80th percentile.

Find area = 0.8 in the table.  Closest:  area = 0.7995 -> Z = 0.84

#### Ex:  

What z-score corresponds to the 99th percentile?

Find area = 0.99 in the table.  Z = 2.33

## Practical Problems:  Forwards

Idea:  convert to z-score, look it up!

   z = (x-mean)/stdev
   
   
#### Ex)  

Height for women in the US follows normal dist with mean 64", stdev 2.4".  Find the probability that random woman is....


a)  P(X<70) = P(Z < (70-64)/2.4)


```{r}
(70-64)/2.4
```

           = P(Z<2.5) = .9938
           
Ie, 99.38% of women are less than 5'10".  

b)  P( 60 < X < 65)  =  P(  (60-64)/2.4  < Z < (65-64)/2.4 )

```{r}
(65 -64)/2.4
```

```{r}
(60-64)/2.4
```

                  = P( -1.67 < Z < 0.42 ) = .6628 - .0475

```{r}
.6628 - .0475
```

Ie, 61.53% of adult women are between 5'0"  and 5'5".  

c)  P(X>75) 

```{r}
(75 - 64)/2.4
```


     = P(Z>4.58) ~~ 0
     
Moral of the story:  even if Z is "off the charts", don't let that stop you!

d)  P(X<75) ~~ 1

## Practical Backwards Problems

Idea:  look up z-score, solve for x.  

    z = (x-mean)/stdev
    
    x = z*stdev + mean
    
#### Ex: 

IQ follows a normal dist with mean 100, stdev 15.  

a)  How high must one's IQ be in order to be in the top 10%?

Ie, 90th percentile.  Look up area = 0.9000 in the table.  

Z = 1.28  


    z = (x - mean)/stdev
    
    1.28 = (x - 100)/15
    
    x = 1.28*15 + 100
    
    
```{r}
1.28*15 + 100
```
    
You'd need an IQ of at least 119.2 to be in the top 10%.  


b)  What IQ marks the 25th percentile?

In table, find area = 0.25

z = -.67

    -.67 = (x - 100)/15

```{r}
(-.67)*15+100
```

An IQ of 90 is at the 25th percentile.  

# Friday March 26

## "Middle Percent" Problems

### Ex)  

Height for men is normal with mean 69" stdev 2.7".

Q:  What's the range of the middle 50% of heights for men?

Note:  backwards!  Given area, need ranges of heights.


Need to look up area.  But, what area?

For lo cutoff, look up area = 0.25, z = -0.67

For hi cutoff, look up area = 0.75, z = +0.67

Find heights:

lo:
     z = (x-mean)/stdev
     -0.67 = (x-69)/2.7
     
```{r}
-.67*2.7+69
```


hi:
```{r}
.67*2.7+69
```

Cutoffs for middle 50%:  from 67.2" to 70.8".  

Range:

```{r}
70.8-67.2
```

Note:  This is IQR!  Range of middle 50%!

### Ex)  

Mean IQ is 100, stdev 15, normal.  Find range of middle 90% of IQ.

Find area = .05, both z=1.64 and 1.65 are equally good, split the diff:  

     z = +/- 1.645

Cutoffs:  

      x  = z*stdev+mean
      
```{r}
-1.645*15 + 100
```
     
```{r}
1.645*15 + 100
```
 
Range between 75.3 and 124.7:

```{r}
124.7-75.3
```

CUTOFF FOR QUIZ.  Quiz:  normal dist!  forwards and backwards!  basic and practical!  need z-table  


## Sampling Distributions

So far: asking questions about individuals.  

A "sampling dist" is a probability distribution for the likelihood of a SAMPLE STATISTIC.

- How likely is our sample mean?        xbar
- How likely is our sample propotion?   phat
- How likely is our sample stdev?       s_x
- How likely is our cor coef?           r

Ie:  NOT ABOUT INDIVIDUALS!  Instead, describing ENTIRE SAMPLES!


### Ex)  

Suppose we roll two dice.  Find the sampling dist for their mean, **xbar**.

Need two things:

- All possible values of xbar (all possible means of two dice)
- Find their probabilities



    xbar = 1   -- (1,1)
    
    xbar = 1.5   -- (1,2), (2,1)
    
    xbar = 2   -- (1,3), (3,1), (2,2)
    
    xbar = 2.5   --  (1,4), (4,1), (2,3), (3,2)
    
    xbar = 3   --  (1,5), (5,1), (2,4), (4,2), (3,3)
    
    xbar = 3.5   --  (1,6), (6,1), (2,5), (5,2) ,(3,4), (4,3)  
    
    xbar = 4   --  (2,6), (6,2), (3,5), (5,3), (4,4) 
    
    ..
    
    xbar = 6  -- (6,6)

Picture!  

![](https://share.sketchpad.app/21/667-c09e-006730.png)

Observations:

1)  Shape has changed!  X has a "flat" distribution, Xbar has a peak in the middle

2)  Spread has changed!  X has larger spread than xbar!

3)  Center has not changed!  

These are always true for ALL sampling dists, no matter what x is, no matter what n (sample size):

 - shape becomes more peaked in the middle (sound familiar?)
 - spread smaller as n bigger
 - center never changes!
