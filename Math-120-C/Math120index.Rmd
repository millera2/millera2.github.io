## Quiz 11

**Be sure you have access to a working computer.**  Make sure you can log into Notebowl.  Have a backup if you're worried (library, computer lab, etc).  

If Notebowl freezes up during the quiz, **REFRESH THE PAGE IMMEDIATELY**.  I promise you won't lose any work!

Reading:  5.3, 6.1

Topics:  Hypothesis tests for mu and p.  Hypotheses, test statistics, p-values, conclusions.  Significance level.  t-dist.

Practice Problems:

- 5.15, 5.17 (p202)
- 5.21 (p203)
- 6.11a, 6.13 (p216)

## Old Practice Problems

### Week 10

- 5.7 (p187)
- 5.11 (p188)
- 5.13 (p188)
- 6.15 (p216)
- The admissions office want to estimate the mean IQ of DU students.  They take a sample of 50 DU students, and find their mean IQ to be 108.3.  Construct a 90% confidence interval for the mean IQ of all DU students.  You may use sigma = 15.
- Suppose the admissions office wants a 99% CI with error no greater than 2.  How many students must they sample?

<small>Answers  (don't look!): (104.8, 111.8),  n=373  </small>

### Week 9

- Suppose the amount of time it takes students in a large math class to finish a quiz follows a normal distribution with mean 14 min, stdev 2.5 min.  

a)  What's the probability it takes a student between 10 and 15 minutes?


b)  How fast must a student finish in order to be in the bottom 1% of times?


c)  If we take a sample of 10 students, what's the probability that their average time taken is greater than 15 minutes?

d)  If we take a sample of 40 students, how high must their mean time taken be in order to be in the top 10% (longest times) for such samples?


e)  For which of the above (a-d) did we need to know in advance that finish times follow a normal distribution?

    <small> <b>Answers</b> (Stop looking!!!):  a) .6006   b)  8.18 min   c) .1030  d) 14.506  e) All except d </small>

- At DU, 77% of students are from out of state.  If we take a sample of 100 students, what's the probability that fewer than 75% of them are from out-of-state?

    <small> <b>Answer</b> (Hey!  Cut it out!!): .3156 </small>
    


### Week 8

- 4.1 (p142)
- 4.3 (a-g only) (p142)

- What's the cutoff for the upper 15% of the z dist? (<small><i>Answer (don't look yet! heystopityou'relooking!!!): 1.04</i></small>)

- What are the cutoffs for the middle 50% of the Z dist?  (<small><i>Answer (don't look yet! heystopityou'relooking!!!): -0.67, +0.67</i></small>)

- The amount of time it takes Prof Miller to walk to school varies uniformly between 8 and 10 minutes.  Sketch the distribution, and compute the probabaility that it takes her at least 8.5 minutes.  (<small><i>Answer(don't look yet! heystopityou'relooking!!!): 75% </i></small>)

## Office Hours 

If you want to see me in person, I'm in my office (Fellows 212) **Wed 2:30pm-4pm.**

Or, you can catch me on Zoom by appointment.  Don't be shy!  A few things:

- Schedule 24 hours in advance
- I'm free most weekdays from 2-4pm
- When you write, **propose a time** to cut down on back-and-forth.

I never check email after 4pm, so **don't wait till the night before a deadline to get help!**  

I like chatting with students -- come find me!





## TA Hours

We have two excellent TAs - Ted and Eliza.  Both are former students of mine.  Go hang out with them.  Hours:


Eliza:   Monday 4-6pm

Ted:  Sunday 4-7pm, Wednesday 4:30-6:30pm

All hours are held in **Olin 215**, just down the hall from our regular classroom.
