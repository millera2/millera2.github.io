**Be sure you have access to a working computer.**  Make sure you can log into Notebowl.  Have a backup if you're worried (library, computer lab, etc).  

If Notebowl freezes up during the quiz, **REFRESH THE PAGE IMMEDIATELY**.  I promise you won't lose any work!

## Office Hours 

If you want to see me in person, I'm in my office (Olin 214) **Wed 2:30pm-4pm.**

Or, you can catch me on Zoom by appointment.  Don't be shy!  A few things:

- Schedule 24 hours in advance
- I'm free most weekdays from 2-4pm
- When you write, **propose a time** to cut down on back-and-forth.

I never check email after 4pm, so **don't wait till the night before a deadline to get help!**  

I like chatting with students -- come find me!





## TA Hours

We have two excellent TAs - Ted and Eliza.  Both are former students of mine.  Go hang out with them.  Hours:


Eliza:   Monday 4-6pm

Ted:  Sunday 4-7pm, Wednesday 4:30-6:30pm

All hours are held in **Olin 215**, just down the hall from our regular classroom.
