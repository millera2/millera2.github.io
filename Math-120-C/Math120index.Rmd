[Google Meet Room](https://meet.google.com/wtr-funk-wph)

All virtual, all by appointment.  Don't be shy!  A few things:

- Schedule 24 hours in advance
- I'm free most weekdays from 1:30-4pm
- When you write, propose a time to cut down on back-and-forth.

I never check email after 4pm, so **don't wait till the night before a deadline to get help!**  

I like chatting with students -- come find me!
