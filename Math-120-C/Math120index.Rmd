## Next Quiz

Topics:

- Type I and Type II error
- alpha, beta, power
- Hyp test for rho
- CI for slope

Reading:

- 8.4

Practice:


- Prof Miller wants to run for Mayor of Granville.  First, she wants to take a poll of local residents to see if more than half of people will vote for her.  She collects the data, and performs a hypothesis test.  Explain, in context, what Type I and Type II error mean in this case.  Which do you think would be worse, and why?
- In a dataset containing measurements of the height and weight of 40 men, the correlation coefficient is computed to be 0.71.  Does this provide strong evidence of a linear relationship between height and weight?  Hyp Test.
- Suppose, using the above data, we wish to predict weight based on height.  We compute:
  - yhat = 84.4 + 1.24*x
  - SSResid = 19.34
  - sum( (x-xbar)^2 ) = 8753
  
  Construct a 98% CI for the slope of the regression.  Interpret what it means.

## Office Hours 

If you want to see me in person, I'm in my office (Olin 214) **Monday 12:30-2:20pm**

Or, you can catch me on Zoom by appointment.  Don't be shy!  A few things:

- Schedule 24 hours in advance
- I'm free most weekdays from 2-4pm
- When you write, **propose a time** to cut down on back-and-forth.

I never check email after 4pm, so **don't wait till the night before a deadline to get help!**  

I like chatting with students -- come find me!
