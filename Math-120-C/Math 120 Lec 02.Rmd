## Visualizations for Categorical Variables

Number one most important:  

(Note:  Never, ever use pie charts.  Never trust anyone who does!)

Heights of the bars represent ...

Look like histograms, but a couple of important differences...




Most important takeaway from a bar graph:  ...


## Textbook:  2.1-2.2.  Measures of center and spread for quant variables

Idea:  need objective measures of center and spread for datasets.


Of course the picture is crucial, but need to agree on statistics.

There are many measures for both center and spread.  They were created by people!  They have strenghts and weaknesses.  Always need to consider context!


## Measures of Center

Center: what's typical in a dataset?

There are several measures of center:

1) 

2) 

3) 


Important note: it's not the case that one measure is "better"!  But, sometimes one is more appropriate than the other!

Ex:  Made-up data:  1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 19


Mean:  ...

Median:  ...

Seems like [...] did a better job of describing "typical" elements.  

Notice that the strong right skew has a big effect on ...



Takeaways:

1)  A statistic is **robust** if ...

2)  If our dataset contains skew/outliers (check the picture!), then it's best to use ...

3)  In a skew dataset, the tail affects...

  - In left skew, we see ...
  - In a symmetric dist, ...
  - In a right skew dist, ...


Ex)  Consider the salaries of all employees at a very large corporation with thousands of employees from custodial staff, retail, etc all the way up to the CXO.  

What shape would you expect this distribution to have?  Which is a more appropriate measure of center, the mean or the median?

Which is bigger:  mean salary, or median salary?  


Ex)  Consider exam scores for a large class on an EASY exam.

## Measures of Spread

Last time:  measures of center.  This time:  measures of spread.

There are three main measures:

1)  
2)  

Thoughts:

  1)  Why do we square the deviations?  

  2) What are the units of stdev?  

Measure of spread #3)  


Since the IQR is unaffected by the lower 25% and upper 25% of the data, it is quite robust!


**Key takeaway**:  

- If data has skew/outliers, describe it with ...
- If data is (roughly) symmetric, use ...

Above:  which has larges spread?  Smallest spread?  Smallest center?


## Statistical Inference

We've seen several numerical summaries so far -- *mean*, median, mode, iqr, *stdev*, range, *proportion.*


But, so far, we've worked exclusively with **sample data**.  

Our goal is to say something about **populations**.  Ex:  all university students ,all americans, all humans, all tax payers, all irises, all cars, etc.  


Unfortuanately, populations tend to be large (much too large!) for us to collect data about every individual.

Compromise:  study a subset of the population, called a sample!  We -hope- that the sample is representative, but always sample data is limited!  

**Statististical Inference** is the process of ...

Every numerical summary has two versions:

- **Statistics** are ...

- **Parameters** are ...

Examples:


- Mean.  
  - Sample mean. ... 
  - Pop mean.     ...
  

  
- Std Dev.
  - Sample stdev. ...
  - Pop stdev.    ...
  

  
- Proportion.  (ie, the major categorical statistic.  same as "percentage")
  - Sample prop. ...
  - Pop prop.     ...
