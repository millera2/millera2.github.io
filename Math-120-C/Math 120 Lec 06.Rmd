Probability Dist Example:  Sum of two dice.

#### Ex:  Sum of Two Dice

We roll two dice, record x = their sum.  Construct a prob dist for x.  



Terminology:  The set of all possible values for X (everything that has non-zero probability) for a distribution is called the "support" for the distro.  

Previous example:  Support:  X = 2, 3, 4, ...., 12

####  Important properties of Prob Dists

1)  
2)  








### Complement

Notation:  The "complement" of event A is:  A' or A^C:  All possible outcomes NOT contained in A.  

Probability:

     P(A')  = 1 - P(A)
     
Think:  A and A' together have all possibilities.  So:

     P(A) + P(A') = 1
     
     
#### Ex.  "At least one"

Suppose we flip a coin three times.  What's the probability that at least one shows heads?

Note:  this is a big complex event!




#### Ex:  At least one

At DU, 19% of students are international.  If we take a random sample of 10 students, what's the probability that at least one of them is an international student?








### Independence/ Mult Rule


Recall:  Two events are **disjoint** if ...

We say that two events A,B are **independent** if ...


Otherwise, we say that they're "dependent" (or not independent).  

Ex:  The event "it's cloudy" and the event "it's raining" are likely not independent.  

Ex:  If we roll a dice twice, the outcome of the first doesn't affect the outcome of the second.  Independent!


#### Multiplcation Rule for Independent Events:

If A,B are independent:

     P(A and B) = P(A)*P(B)
     
Think:  for independent events, "and" means "times"

NOTE:  WORKS BOTH WAYS!  If P(A and B) = P(A)*P(B), then A and b are indep!


Ex:  Suppose we flip a coin 5 times.

a)  P(H, H, H, T, H) = ...


b)  P(H, H, H, H, H) = ...


#### Ex:  

Roll a dice.  What's the prob we get 1, then an even?



#### Ex:  

We pick a card from the deck (52 card poker).  Without replacing it, we pick a second.  What's the probability that both are hearts?

  

Q:  What if we'd replaced the first at random?  


Idea:  "sampling with replacement".  If not, events might NOT BE INDEPENDENT!  

#### Ex:  

There are 2300 Students at DU.  1200 students are women, 1100 students are men.  If we take a sample of two students, what's the probability that they're both women?

a)  "Without replacement"


b)  "With replacement"


# Wed Mar 10

### Sampling w/ Replacement vs Not


MORAL OF THE STORY:  If our population is "large", we can assume that sampling is INDEPENDENT.  Probabilities are basically the same.


What's "large enough"?  Answer:  ...


#### Ex:  

Suppose we take a random sample of 30 DU students.  Can we assume that these events (each student) are independent?



#### Ex:  

If we select two cards at random from a 52 card deck, can we assume indep?











### Conditional Probabity 

    P(A | B) = "probability of A given B"
             = if we know that B occured, how likely is A?
             
Ex:

     P(Rains | Cloudy) = ?
     
     
Make a picture!

Think:  "and on top, given on the bottom"


#### Ex:  

At DU, 51% of students are female, 17% of students are both female and a STEM major.

If we select a random female student, what's the probability that she's a STEM major?



#### Ex:  mpg

```{r}
table(mpg$year, mpg$drv) %>% addmargins()
```


a)  If we randomly select a car from 1999, what's the probability it has front wheel drive?


b)  Are the events "from 2008" and "rear wheel drive" indep?



MORAL:  for indep, check mult rule!

### General Multiplication Rule

So far:

A,B are disjoint ->
  
    P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)
    
For ANY A,B:
    
    P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
    
If A,B are independent:

    P(A and B) = P(A)*P(B)
    
    
Q?  What if A,B indep???? What about P(A and B)????

A:  Conditional probability!  Algebra:

    P(A and B) = ...
               
               
#### Ex:  

I'm walking my dog.  If he sees a squirrel, there's an 82% chance he'll bark.  If he doesn't see a squirrel, there's 27% chance he'll bark.  In my neighborhood, there's a 71% chance he'll see a squirrel.

On a random walk, what's the prob that my dog sees a squirrew and barks?


# Friday Mar 12

#### Ex

Suppose P(A) = .3, P(B) = .4.  Find P(A or B)....

a) if P(A and B) = .05

    P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = .3 + .4 - .05 = .65

b) A,B are indep

    P(A and B) = (.3)*(.4) = .12
    
    ->  P(A or B) = .3 + .4 - .12 = .58

c) A,B are disjoint

    P(A and B) = 0
    
    ->  P(A or B) = .3 + .4 - 0 = .7


d) P(A|B) = .1


    P(A and B) = P(A)*P(B|A)
               = P(B)*P(A|B) = .4*.1 = .04
               
    -> P(A or B) = .3 + .4 - .04 = .66
    
    
#### Ex:  At least one

Suppose we roll a dice 15 times.  What's the probability that at least one time shows "4"?

Complement:  not a 4, not a 4, not a 4, ...... not a 4

    P(none are 4) = (5/6)^15
    
    P(at least 1 shows "4") = 1 - P(none are 4)
                            = 1 - (5/6)^15

```{r}
1 - (5/6)^15
```

```{r}
(5/6)^15
```




### Trees, Total Probability, and Bayes

Ex:  Suppose that a lie detector test claims to be 95% accurate.  This means:  if someone is lying (L), there's a 95% chance the test will show positive (+).  

Further, if a person is not lying (L'), then there's an 88% chance the test shows negative (-).  

In our population, most are honest:  99% of people are honest.  

Conditionals:

P(+|L) = .95
P(-|L) = .05
P(+|L')= .12
P(-|L')= .88

Follow-up questions:  What percent of lie detector test takers get a + result?

Only two possibilies:

 - L and +
 - L' and +
 
 Together:
 
P(+) = P(L and +) + P(L' and +) = .0095 + .1188

```{r}
.0095 + .1188
```

This is the "Law of Total Probability".  In the tree:  add all "and" probs that involve the condition (here: +)


Question 2:  Reminder:  P(+|L) = .95  But, what about other direction?  If I get + result, what's the chance I'm actually a liar?

Looking for:

    P( L | +) = P(L and +)/P(+) = (.0095)/.1283


```{r}
(.0095)/.1283
```

Only 7.4% chance!!!!  This is Bayes Thm, ie, how to reverse the conditionality.

Given:  P(A|B)

Want:   P(B|A) (bayes)

Ex)  A kicker in soccer can either kick:  L, R, or C.  The goalie tries to block (event B).

If the kick is L, then there's a 85% chance of B.
If the kick is R, then there's 70% chance of B.
If the kick is C, then there's a 95% chance of B.

This kicker kicks....

- L 55% of time
- R 30% of time
- C 15% of time


1) COnstruct tree.

2)  What's P(B)?

    .55*.85+.3*.7+.15*.95
```{r}
.55*.85+.3*.7+.15*.95
```

(Total Prob!)

3)  If the ball is blocked, what's the prob it was kicked to the right?

    P( R | B) = P(R and B)/P(B) = .3*.7/.82

```{r}
.3*.7/.82
```


Homework notes:  Contingency Tables (Pivot Tables)

Ex:  mpg:

```{r}
table(mpg$year, mpg$drv)
```

Let's do it  in Google Sheets: Make a table comparing Year in school and Hair color.

   Brn  Black  Red Blonde Other 
F
S
J
S


Ex:  Make a pivot table showing mean height by year in school
    mean height
F
S
J
Sr





Ands:

P(L and +) = P(L)*P(+|L) = 

```{r}
.99*.12
```

.99*.88
```{r}
.99*.88

```




```{r}
64-2*2.4
```

```{r}

## The most important distro:  Normal!

Idea:  you know what a prob dist is.

Now:  Let's learn the most important one:  the normal dist (bell curve!)

Normal Dist:  most of us are in the middle.  It's rare to be large or small!

"The" normal dist is actually a family of distributions.  ALl have same shape, 

 - different center (mean)
 - different spread (std dev)  
 
 
Q:  Given teh center and spread of a normal dist, how do we compute probabilities?
 
### Ex: 

Adult men in the US have mean height 69", stdev 2.7".  What's the probability that a ranom man is less than 71" tall?
 
Ex:  What's the prob that rando man is between 68 an 70" tall?

Idea:  PROBABILITY = AREA

PROBLEM:  Can't do it by hand!

Solution:  Two ways:


1) Statistical Tables.
2)  Software, like Google Sheets!


Problem:  lots of different normal dists!  But, only one table!

Answer:  Always use the same one, the STANDARD NORMAL DISTRIBUTION:

- mean = 0
- std dev = 1


Problem:  What if our data is normal, but not STANDARD normal?  Ex:  height!

ANSWER: Z-SCORES! Z-scores count how many std devs above/below the mean an observation is


    Z = (X-mean)/stdev
    
    
### Ex:  

If Z follows a std normal dist, find....


a)  P(Z<1.23) = .8907

b)  P(Z>1.23) = 1 - P(Z<1.23) = 1-.8907

```{r}
1-.8907
```






# Wed March 24

Last time:  Z table shows area to the left of a z-score (std normal score).

### Ex:  

If Z is std normal, find

a)  P(Z< -1.85) = 0.0322

b)  P(Z > -2.53) = 1 - P(Z < -2.53) 
                 = 1 - .0057

```{r}
1 - .0057
```

c)  P( 0.64 <  Z < 3.12) = P(Z<3.12) - P(<0.64) = .9991 - .7389

```{r}
.9991 - .7389
```


d)  P( -2 < Z < 2) = P(Z<2) - P(Z<-2) = .9773 - .0228

```{r}
.9773 - .0228
```

Ah ha!  That's why the Emprical Rule works!



## Backwards Problems

So far:  given Z, find area/prob.  Forwards!

Now:  given an area/prob, need to find Z.  Backwards!

#### Ex:  

What Z-score seperates the lower 80% of the normal dist from the upper 20%?

Ie, find the 80th percentile.

Find area = 0.8 in the table.  Closest:  area = 0.7995 -> Z = 0.84

#### Ex:  

What z-score corresponds to the 99th percentile?

Find area = 0.99 in the table.  Z = 2.33

## Practical Problems:  Forwards

Idea:  convert to z-score, look it up!

   z = (x-mean)/stdev
   
   
#### Ex)  

Height for women in the US follows normal dist with mean 64", stdev 2.4".  Find the probability that random woman is....


a)  P(X<70) = P(Z < (70-64)/2.4)


```{r}
(70-64)/2.4
```

           = P(Z<2.5) = .9938
           
Ie, 99.38% of women are less than 5'10".  

b)  P( 60 < X < 65)  =  P(  (60-64)/2.4  < Z < (65-64)/2.4 )

```{r}
(65 -64)/2.4
```

```{r}
(60-64)/2.4
```

                  = P( -1.67 < Z < 0.42 ) = .6628 - .0475

```{r}
.6628 - .0475
```

Ie, 61.53% of adult women are between 5'0"  and 5'5".  

c)  P(X>75) 

```{r}
(75 - 64)/2.4
```


     = P(Z>4.58) ~~ 0
     
Moral of the story:  even if Z is "off the charts", don't let that stop you!

d)  P(X<75) ~~ 1

## Practical Backwards Problems

Idea:  look up z-score, solve for x.  

    z = (x-mean)/stdev
    
    x = z*stdev + mean
    
#### Ex: 

IQ follows a normal dist with mean 100, stdev 15.  

a)  How high must one's IQ be in order to be in the top 10%?

Ie, 90th percentile.  Look up area = 0.9000 in the table.  

Z = 1.28  


    z = (x - mean)/stdev
    
    1.28 = (x - 100)/15
    
    x = 1.28*15 + 100
    
    
```{r}
1.28*15 + 100
```
    
You'd need an IQ of at least 119.2 to be in the top 10%.  


b)  What IQ marks the 25th percentile?

In table, find area = 0.25

z = -.67

    -.67 = (x - 100)/15

```{r}
(-.67)*15+100
```

An IQ of 90 is at the 25th percentile.  

# Friday March 26

## "Middle Percent" Problems

### Ex)  

Height for men is normal with mean 69" stdev 2.7".

Q:  What's the range of the middle 50% of heights for men?

Note:  backwards!  Given area, need ranges of heights.


Need to look up area.  But, what area?

For lo cutoff, look up area = 0.25, z = -0.67

For hi cutoff, look up area = 0.75, z = +0.67

Find heights:

lo:
     z = (x-mean)/stdev
     -0.67 = (x-69)/2.7
     
```{r}
-.67*2.7+69
```


hi:
```{r}
.67*2.7+69
```

Cutoffs for middle 50%:  from 67.2" to 70.8".  

Range:

```{r}
70.8-67.2
```

Note:  This is IQR!  Range of middle 50%!

### Ex)  

Mean IQ is 100, stdev 15, normal.  Find range of middle 90% of IQ.

Find area = .05, both z=1.64 and 1.65 are equally good, split the diff:  

     z = +/- 1.645

Cutoffs:  

      x  = z*stdev+mean
      
```{r}
-1.645*15 + 100
```
     
```{r}
1.645*15 + 100
```
 
Range between 75.3 and 124.7:

```{r}
124.7-75.3
```

CUTOFF FOR QUIZ.  Quiz:  normal dist!  forwards and backwards!  basic and practical!  need z-table  


## Sampling Distributions

So far: asking questions about individuals.  

A "sampling dist" is a probability distribution for the likelihood of a SAMPLE STATISTIC.

- How likely is our sample mean?        xbar
- How likely is our sample propotion?   phat
- How likely is our sample stdev?       s_x
- How likely is our cor coef?           r

Ie:  NOT ABOUT INDIVIDUALS!  Instead, describing ENTIRE SAMPLES!


### Ex)  

Suppose we roll two dice.  Find the sampling dist for their mean, **xbar**.

Need two things:

- All possible values of xbar (all possible means of two dice)
- Find their probabilities



xbar = 1   (1,1)
xbar = 1.5 (1,2), (2,1)
xbar = 2   (1,3), (3,1), (2,2)
xbar = 2.5 (1,4), (4,1), (2,3), (3,2)
xbar = 3   (1,5), (5,1), (2,4), (4,2), (3,3)
xbar = 3.5 (1,6), (6,1), (2,5), (5,2) ,(3,4), (4,3)  
xbar = 4   (2,6), (6,2), (3,5), (5,3), (4,4) 
..
xbar = 6   (6,6)

Picture!  

![](https://share.sketchpad.app/21/667-c09e-006730.png)

Observations:

1)  Shape has changed!  X has a "flat" distribution, Xbar has a peak in the middle

2)  Spread has changed!  X has larger spread than xbar!

3)  Center has not changed!  

These are always true for ALL sampling dists, no matter what x is, no matter what n (sample size):

 - shape becomes more peaked in the middle (sound familiar?)
 - spread smaller as n bigger
 - center never changes!
