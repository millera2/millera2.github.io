##  Hyp Tests and Significance: and intro

*[Brief powerpoint in-class, available on Google Drive shared folder.]*

In our reading about Breakfast studies, we learned that p-values and hypothesis tests are often misused.  A big problem:  software like R makeas it super easy to perform the tests, but that doesn't mean you know what you're doing!

A big goal of mine:  to help take the "magic" out of hypothesis tests so that students (you!) can use them appropriately and insightfully.

## Case studies for hyp tests

Let's analyze some examples in-depth, using datasets we're familiar with.

### iris dataset




### mpg dataset


### garlic mustard dataset
